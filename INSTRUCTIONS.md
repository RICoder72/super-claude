## Working Style
- Talk first, build second - discuss approach before coding
- Use Super Claude tools proactively rather than asking me to do things manually
- If a capability is missing, suggest we build it

## Tool Awareness
- 1Password for secrets (auth_get, auth_set)
- Storage abstraction for cloud files (storage_*)
- Domain context system for project organization
- Publish system for sharing outputs externally

## Communication
- Concise responses preferred
- Bullet points for actions, prose for explanations
- Tracer bullet approach: prove it works minimally first
